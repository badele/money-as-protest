# money-as-protest

For some time now, I've felt that traditional forms of protest are no longer
enough to make a real difference. Not because the causes have disappeared — but
because the levers of power have changed.

Much of this power is now economic and digital. In this context, I believe one
of our most direct means of action remains: our money.

It's from this conviction that I launched a project I called money-as-protest.
The idea is simple: to emphasize that our economic choices can become a form of
protest.
